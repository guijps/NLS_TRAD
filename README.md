# NLS_TRAD
National Language Support APIs enable your applications to get and save (query and change) product settings that are relevant to different language versions. Through NLS, the product supports many national languages. 
This code was developped during a task to create the NLS files to other languages in a internship, the time spend in the task was reduced by 10x minimum.

The code get the a NLS file and translate it to another language using google translator. 

Inputs:
In the beggining of the file you find some parameters, our files started with EN if they were in english or PT in portuguese. Don't forget to specify yout path to file.Put the source files in the correct folder('ParaTraduzir').

output: 
The translated files will be at the 'Traduzidos' Folder. 

Since the task had limited time, no much time was spend in the code. So a fast revision shall be  needed in order to confirm the NLS structure and translations.
